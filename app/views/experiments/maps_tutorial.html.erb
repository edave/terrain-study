<h1>Best Hiking Path from A to B</h1>
<p>
    This research is trying to determine if 2D mapping tools, like Google Maps, or 2.5D mapping tools, like Google Earth, 
    allow users to plan better paths between two markers. We are interested in the best path you can create for a group of hikers
    if you were to hike from the start, the tent, to the end, the flag. For example, while the shortest distance "as the crow flies" would
    be a straight line, this might require you to climb over mountain peaks and would mean a slower (and more difficult) hike overall. 
    You will be <b>scored</b> on the following aspects of your path:
    <ol>
        <li>Path length (both in distance and elevation changes). Assume that are you are designing the route for an average group of hikers, 
        irregardless of your personal hiking experience.</li>
        <li>How fast you can create this path</li>
        <li>Using as few waypoints as possible</li>
        <li><b>There is no penalty for deleting waypoints, only your final path is scored</b></li>
    </ol>
    
    Please keep in mind that elevation changes throughout a path add to the 
    overall distance of that path. In other words, while a path going over a mountain may seem shorter, the changes in 
    elevation to travel over that terrain MAY result in a path that is longer than if the route skirted around the mountain. 
    Please keep such points in mind during the experimental task.
</p>

<p>Below we will go over how to use Google Maps and you will have an opportunity to try creating a path before the actual experiment.</p>

<h1>Google Maps Tutorial</h1>
<p>Below is an annotated image of Google Maps and the path planning interface you will use in this experiment.</p>
<img src="/images/map-tutorial.png" style="border:1px solid #aaa;" />
<h2>Google Maps Controls</h2>
<p>Use the icons in the top left corner of the map to move the map. The +/- buttons below can be used to zoom in on the map. You can also click and drag the map at any point to move the map in and out.</p>
<p><b>You can use your mouse wheel to zoom in and out on the map.</b></p>
<h2>Path Planning Tools</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The Start is a tent, the Finish is a flag</li>
    <li>Waypoints are represented by the red markers</li>
    <li>You can move waypoints by pressing your mouse button down when the mouse 
    cursor is over a waypoint and drag the waypoint to a new location.</li>
    <li>You can delete waypoints by clicking on a waypoint, and then clicking 'delete me' in the white bubble</li>
</ul>

<h1>Topographic Maps and Contour Lines</h1>
<img src="/images/contour-lines.png" style="border:1px solid #aaa;" />
<p>Topographic maps and contour lines are used to represent changes in elevation on a normal map. 
Each contour line on the map represents the elevation of the terrain along that line. If you are not familiar with contour
lines, please read this <a href="http://raider.muc.edu/~mcnaugma/Topographic%20Maps/contour.htm" target="_blank">explanation</a>, as
understanding contour lines will be crucial to your success in this task.</p>
<p>Remember, the closer together the contour lines are, the steeper the change in elevation. Contour lines which are further apart
indicate a gentler slope.</p>

<h1>Path Planning Tool Example</h1>
<p>For this tutorial, please play around with the tools until you feel comfortable. </p>
<p>Below is an example of the path planning tool. Try to do the following:
<ul>
    <li>Move the map around to find the start and finish</li>
    <li>Create a Waypoint</li>
    <li>Delete a Waypoint</li>
    <li>Zoom in to see the contour lines</li>
</ul>
</p>
	</div>
    <div id="content" style="width:450px; height:450px; border:1px solid #aaa" >Loading...</div>
        
    <div style="float: left; margin-left: 10px;">
		<h2 id="time">Starting Experiment...</h2>
		<h2  id="num-waypoints">No Waypoints</h2>
		<div id="finished" style="display:none;">Click to Finish!</div>
		<br/>
		<a id="next-step" href="/experiments/choose/0" style="display:none; text-decoration:underline;">Continue &raquo;</a>
		<div id="waypoint-list" style="border:1px solid #ececec; visibility: hidden; display:none;">
</div>
</div>
<br style="clear:both;" />
<br />
<p>Remember that for the experimental task, however, we will be recording the distance of the path you create, 
with shortest paths being best, and the length of time to create the path, with faster times being best. Finally, please use 
as few waypoints as possible to create your path. <b>You will need to zoom in and examine the contour lines to produce a good path!</b></p>
