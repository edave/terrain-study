<h2>Welcome to the Terrain Display Study</h2>
        <p>The goal of this project is to assess the impact of dimension on a userâ€™s ability to understand 
        their environment. More specifically, we hope to determine if a navigational task through diverse 
        terrain is better assisted with a 2D map interface, or a 2.5D map interface. </p>
        <h2>Requirements</h2>
        <p>You will need a modern browser which can display Google Maps and Google Earth, below are examples of both. 
        You will need to have the Google Earth Plugin installed, (free from Google) in order to participate
        in this study. If you do not have the plugin installed, the box below will give you instructions on how to 
        download and install Google Earth. <b style="color:#b33">You will need to restart your web browser if you install the Google Earth Plugin</b></p>
